                THE FIRST-EVER LX F SPORT HANDLING <br>

            <br> Completely reimagined for 2022, the all-new LX represents the next chapter of 
            flagship luxury. Its exterior, a study in sophistication and strength, exhibits a silhouette that perfectly complements any road, on-road or off.* 
            And the first-ever LX F SPORT Handling elevates your drive to its most visceral heights. 
            Featuring aerodynamically enhanced bodywork, exclusive 22-inch wheels and a race-inspired interior, 
            this SUV stands in a class of its own.
            <br> 
            <br>THE MOST ADVANCED LX EVER <br>

            <br> The all-new Lexus Interface* seamlessly connects you via touchscreen–or 
            your voice–to an Intelligent Assistant* that gets smarter over time. And wirelessly integrates with Apple CarPlay®* or Android Auto™.* 
            It’s the convenience of more than 19 inches of screen access, including a lower display that’s designed to inform, not distract. 
            Combined with next-generation off-road* camera systems and the most 
            immersive audio experience ever offered in an LX, 
            this is technology as it should be.
